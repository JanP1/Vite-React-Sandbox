# React Sandbox
Just some react, typescript and css stuff.
 

The following aspects are to be worked on:
* **Grid display in css** - to make the app responsive
* **Typescript in general** - learning the language and its features in order to use it in other apps
* <span style='color:lightgreen'>**Global values**</span> - how to manage state in a way that i can access values from specific parts of the app with as little rerendering as possible


## Currently working on:
### 1. Navigation
